# Breadboard Power Connectors
I got tired of dealing with mediocre screw terminals on breadboard panels and made this to use banana jacks to link to terminal blocks. There are two pairs spaced to match dual-banana connector cables. One pair has through-hole spaces that either need diodes as designed, a fuse, or simple bridge to connect it through.
